## API and Data Sample

Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This __must__ be properly formatted. An example is below:

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
*These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.*

- Get questions and answers from airtable 
- use form to add new quetions and answers to airtable
- Homepage funcationality to be repsonsive 
- Delete posts from feed


#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

- Add second API
- Render pictures for Hogwarts exploring 


## Project Schedule

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all parts of your app.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the app must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add an additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths: I can completely visualy how I want my app to look at the end. I have committed to my time frames to help me excute my visual

### Weaknesses: I am still struggling a little with fully understanding REACT. I do know where to get help and I am aware I need to ask for it when I am stuck. 

### Opportunities: This project in general is going to help me so much in understanding REACT more and how to put it all together better. 

### Threats: I won't lie I'm really bad with asking for help when I am stuck. I need to be better about reaching out and asking questions. Im planning on doing that more with this project
